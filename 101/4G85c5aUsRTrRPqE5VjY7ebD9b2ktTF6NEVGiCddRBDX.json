It was a warm summer day, full of raging ionic storms. Lightning was piercing the sky as Bekalu took off his helmet and locked eyes with her. 'What are the chances of nearly colliding with someone flying through these wastelands on a day like this', he smiled with his booming voice. 'Perhaps it's destiny,' she smiled back mysteriously. There was another strike of lightning, but this time the sky remained calm."}}
